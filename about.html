        <p>
            I am a Game Design major at MSU. I have developed several projects, both for school projects along with
            personal projects and Game Jams. I have experience both in solo development and with working in groups.
            I specialize in borh programming and design and dabble in 3D modeling. I also have creative experience
            coming up with many unique game ideas and concepts. Some of my favorite games to work on are shooters
            and horror games.
